# Cone Collector
This is a 3D-printable assistive mechanism for collecting plastic fitness cones. The design was inspired by a spear, the mechanical funcationality comes from the intrinsic elasticity of 3D printing filament.
# Printing Instructions
The working prototype was printed on a BambuLab X1 Carbon, with the following settings:
* 200C extruder temp.
* 60C bed temp.
* 2 shells.
* Vertical supports and bridging.
* 0.1mm layer height.
* 15% infill density.
